  description: A simple API to interact with the Core Tunnel Management Function.
    Supports creating and removing tunnels on this domains. Is advised to allocate
    resources by external ESMFs. The CTMF is a subset of the ESMF. Please refer to
    the topology drawings for further information about the network structures.
