\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
In the current world of IoT a lot of small devices flood our networks that are prone to vulnerabilities due to infrequent updates and critical vulnerabilities shipped from factory. Due to this, network engineers are challenged with a new level of threats on their networks, calling for a zero trust approach of all participating devices. Network slicing is an integral part of protection against these threats, as it provides the necessary isolation required for a zero trust approach. There is however currently a lack of network slicing solutions that span multiple domains and have investigated security aspects thoroughly enough for deployment in mission critical contexts. In this thesis we thus wish to build a network slicing architecture spanning multiple domains with a focus on security and resilience.
