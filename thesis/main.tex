When thinking about partitioning or slicing a part of a network, traditionally VLANs (virtual local area network) \cite{IEEE8021Q} or VXLANs (virtual extended local area network) \cite{rfc7348} come to mind. The goal of VLAN or VXLAN is to annotate packets with an id to distinguish certain traffic from other traffic. As the name suggests a virtual LAN will act as an emulated LAN on top of a real-world LAN, partitioning a switch or other network hardware. This is achieved by maintaining different routing tables based on the specific VLAN, enabling network administrators to specify where packets from a certain VLAN may or may not go. VLANs can be distinguished by tagged and untagged VLANs \cite[25.2]{IEEE8021Q}. Originally only untagged (also called port based) VLANs were available, where a specific switch port is assigned to a specific VLAN, binding this port statically \cite[25.3]{IEEE8021Q}. It was thus a full hardware separation but on the other hand also quite inflexible with the static port binding. To combat this issue, tagged VLANs were developed. Tagged VLANs use information stored within the network packet headers to assign a VLAN id to each packet \cite{IEEE8021Q}. While this creates a small overhead on the network, it allows to share one port between multiple VLANs. For example, the IEEE 802.1 Q standard defines a commonly used VLAN solution that encapsulates the original packet in a VLAN header, including a 12-bit VLAN id. As networks evolved however, more than 4096 VLAN ids were needed and other means of tagged VLANs were implemented, such as Cisco Systems' Private VLAN (RFC 5517) \cite{rfc5517} or VXLAN (RFC 7348). VXLAN for example uses 24-bit ids and can thus provide a way bigger value space than the header of IEEE 802.1 Q.

Another way to achieve this kind of functionality is by using tunnels through a certain part of the network. A common approach to use are for example GRE tunnels \cite{rfc2784}, which enable the network administrator to send arbitrary network protocols over another arbitrary protocol, differentiated by an optional key found in the GRE packet header.

In the modern context of 5G networks, the term slicing has been established to provide a slice of network, computational or storage resources from a certain network that are guaranteed to be available to an application after their reservation \cite{5G1,5G2,5G3,5G4} and that isolate components resource wise. Slicing has the advantage over the previously mentioned VLANs, that slices can also provide resource guarantees, while in a traditional VLAN setup all VLANs share the same resource pool (without any additional configuration). Furthermore 5G network slices can be requested live by users and applications following for example the 3GPP 5G network slicing specification (TS 28.530) [CITATION NEEDED] that is currently still under development, while VLANs are set up by network administrators in advance and do not dynamically change.

In general there are many approaches that focus on slicing on a single, local administrative domain (a network managed by one system administrator/team) \cite{SD1,SD2,SD3}. Examples for this are the resource allocation framework proposed by Mathieu Leconte et al. \cite{SD3} focussing on the resource management of 5G slicing on local domains, the mobile handover strategies discussed by Haijun Zhang et al. \cite{SD1} for future mobile networks and slicing of local domains in the context of IoT \cite{SD2}.

Furthermore there are also projects to create slices over multiple domains \cite{MD1,MD2,MD3,MD4,MD5}, such as the network slicing framework proposed by Ibrahim Afolabi et al. \cite{MD1} building around a "Dynamic Adaption Stack" offering services such as provisioning, accounting and more. Another such framework is SliceNet \cite{MD3}, which aims to provide an initial implementation of slicing in 5G networks and is a project of the EU 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership (5G PPP). Others are investigating the role of QoS in cross-domain slicing, such as Vasileios Theodorou et al. \cite{MD4} in their network of wind turbines in Denmark, while Ivana Kovacevic et al. \cite{MD5} aim to route slice traffic among multiple routes based on their estimated time of arrival to provide a network with more stable latency. These solutions often use NFV to manage, orchestrate and deploy the slicing network, as NFV provides excellent flexibility to build network topologies in a SDN context \cite{5GSDN1,5GSDN2}.

So as one can see, there are a lot of topics in this field that are currently being investigated by researchers and industry all over the world due to its key role in future communication systems.  And while slicing is an amazing opportunity to face many application demands and security concerns with modern IoT devices by isolating them from other network participants, there are also security concerns of attackers jeopardizing network slicing in such a network, resulting in QoS decrease, outages and spying attempts on possibly all applications within \cite{SE1}. To combat these threats, Vitor A. Cunha et al. \cite{SE1} have formerly described the well estabilished protection goals of confidentiality, availability, integrity, authentication and authorization for slicing applications. Their results are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confidentiality: The slice contents must not be disclosed outside of the end devices and authorized devices participating in the slice.
    \item Availability: The system must perform correctly under the specific service level agreement and all VNFs within a slice must be available at all times. There is however no guarantee that new slices may always be able to be established when resource availability does not permit it.
    \item Integrity: There may be no side channels to slices (all data must go through the slice and not through other interfaces) and all participants of a slice may not be under influence of attackers that could tamper with data or replace functionality in an undetected way.
    \item Authentication: All human and device participants must be authenticated at all time to perform actions of any kind on slices or the underlying infrastructure.
    \item Authorization: To perform actions on specific slices or infrastructure, the specific user must be allowed to do so, for example by having ownership of the slice.
\end{itemize}
Ruxandra Olimid et. al \cite{SE2} try a different approach of classifying threats as either life-cycle, inter-slice or intra-slice security concerns. Life-cycle threats are threats to the bootstrapping or removal of slices, threatening their existence. Inter-slice threats are threats like side-channel attacks or information disclosure, that take place when two different isolated parties have means to communicate with each other or obtain information about one another without being part of the same slice. Information disclosure can also happen when one participant is part of multiple slices and shares information that was only meant for one slice. The intra-slice threats are then threats within the slice itself, such as a malicious participant.
To protect slicing implementations against these threats and to reach protection goals, Tomasz Wichary et al. \cite{SE3} suggested different security controls to isolate certain parts of networks that are otherwise only weakly isolated. They reach their goals by employing security policies to certain parts of the slicing network to achieve good resource isolation on multiple layers while utilizing vendor specific and vendor independent tools. Niklas Fuhrberg et al. \cite{SE4} investigated QoS degradation in their NFV based slicing topology that spanned multiple virtual domains with a single administrative entity called ESMF (edge slice management function). They validated their topology in a local testbed using Mininet \cite{mininet} (a network emulator) reaching the result that an adversary attacking a switch from multiple angles can still overload the switch and reach considerate QoS degradation in their example of controlling a remote robot.

In this thesis we wish to build a topology with a distributed control plane and management to create a network slicing testbed based on NFV and SFC. We will attempt to redesign the topology by Fuhrberg et al. to reach full network isolation of slices from one another, as well as distributed trust among the different participating administrative domains.
To achieve these goals, we impose the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item R1: We want our slices to be fully isolated concerning network resources. Adversaries [LINK] should not be able to violate our protection goals [LINK].
    \item R2: We want to build a slicing network that spans multiple domains that are administered by multiple parties. We require this to be able to establish slicing communication over participating third party networks such as the DFN (German Research Network) without requiring to trust the 3rd-party networks apart from respecting their SLA (service level agreement). This includes a fully distributed control and data plane.
    \item R3: We want our solution to be able to run on real-world networks to be able to obtain real-world results apart from small local testbenches. This is also important to be able to evaluate our QoS requirements on specialized hardware like real-world switches that can leverage hardware acceleration.
    \item R4: We want to be able to create slices from an arbitrary amount of networks to an arbitrary amount of other networks. While one slice must only connect two networks, other networks should be reachable as well, as most modern applications wish to reach out to multiple parties in multiple destinations.
\end{itemize}

Question 1: Are the requirements good like this? I provide requirements here with an additional reference to our attackers and protection goals so that we can a) use R2, R3 and R4 to distinguish our new solution from Niklas' solution passively (no active comparison) and b) use R1 to validate our protection goals later. With this we can later validate our solution using the requirement list with embedded protection goals, which would be a good solution in my opinion (to not validate everything separately). We will of course argue that R2-4 are by design. Are any requirements missing in your opinion?

Question 2: Is Niklas' thesis appropriately mentioned? I stated our solution as a redesign of his, because even though all the VNFs are completely redesigned and reimplemented (sometimes even in their base concepts of operation, like by which means things are communicated and deployed), the basic concept of a chain of ESMF->DSMF is almost the same. Our components are different of course (for example the role of the ESMF for other networks, the synchronization, the ryu controller as way to deploy the flows, and also the isolation itself). Should Niklas' thesis be mentioned later on? I do not currently think that comparing the works more than above is needed, as I already mentioned a core difference above (the role of the ESMF ["with a single administrative entity called ESMF"]). I would thus like to continue with the upcoming chapters without further referencing it. Is that a good approach or would it be ideal to further mention it?

Question 3: Is the presented related work relevant in your opinion or should I explore a certain field more?
